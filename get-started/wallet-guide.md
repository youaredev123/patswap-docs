# Create a Wallet

![](../.gitbook/assets/docs-masthead-9-.png)

To get started on PancakeSwap, the first thing you'll need is to set up a wallet that supports Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\). Wallets are available both on desktop computers and on smartphone devices. You'll need to choose the wallet that fits your needs best.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**When you're setting up a wallet, be sure to:**

* ‚úÖ **Download and install only the latest version from an official source.**
* ‚úÖ **Follow the setup guide carefully.**
* ‚úÖ **Safely back up your recovery phrases.**
* ‚ùå **NEVER share your recovery phrases with anyone, under any circumstances.**
* ‚ùå **NEVER input your recovery phrase to a website or app, other than your wallet app.**
{% endhint %}
